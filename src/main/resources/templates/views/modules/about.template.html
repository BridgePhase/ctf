			<h2>Our approach</h2>
			<p>Our goal was to create an application using data from  <a class="underline" href="https://open.fda.gov" target="_blank">Open FDA</a> that demonstrated various ways of consumption. This application 
			shows 4 different approaches of consuming and presenting said data.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Initial stage</h3>
			<p>
				<img src="/ctf/images/whiteboarding.jpg"
					class="article-picture article-right" 
					alt="Whiteboard picture with the teams' original ideas" 
					title="Our initial whiteboarding ideas" />

				When starting the project during our whiteboarding sessions, our initial concern was 
				formulating an idea to proceed with the various types of data provided. We saw that 
				the Open FDA site already provided graphical information about some sample queries 
				so we understood that we would need to go beyond simple graphing. One part that jumped 
				out was the statistic on one of the Open FDA graphs about recalls with the word "ice cream"
				in the description. So as a first go, we came up with the idea that it would be very 
				informative to generate headlines using the data from Open FDA in a human readable format
				as opposed to a graph. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This idea worked well, and some of us being Bill Nye fans, we decided to name the site
				"Consider the following", based on a segment of his "Bill Nye the Science Guy" show. His
				segment presented viewers with cool facts about various subjects so we decided to present
				cool automatically generated statistics derived from the Open FDA data. With our main idea
				in place, we decided to work with all three types of datasets (food, medicines, and
				 medical devices). Our goal was to show three types of data interaction based on the amount
				 and usability of the data Open FDA provides. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Through some brainstorming, we came up with the following:
				<ol>
					<li>For Food, we show the site user recalls by state</li>
					<li>For Medicines, we allow the user to search for events related to a certain medicine</li>
					<li>For Medical Devices, we show the user a pre-defined search and allow them to view details.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Food</h3>
			<p>
				The goal of this page is to show food recalls that affect a given state. In order to make 
				it more usable, the application pre-selects the current user's state based on 
				geolocation information. The application also highlights information about the recall and
				populates a US map based on other areas affected by the same recall. If the user needs more
				information about the manufacturer, the application provides a link to Google search results
				based on the manufacturer's name and address.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Medicines</h3>
			<p>
				The medicines page allows the user to search for one or many medcines to generate a graph of
				adverse events reported in which the patient was known to be taking those medicines. The application
				queries Open FDA for counts of various serious adverse events including deaths, hopitalizations,
				and life threatening events. Using this data, the application generates a stacked bar chart using
				the <a class="underline" href="http://c3js.org" target="_blank">C3 graphing library</a>.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Medical Devices</h3>
			<p>
				The data the Open FDA API provides for medical devices doesn't lend itself to the general public.
				Due to this, the application keeps this screen simple and renders the results of a pre-defined query
				to a list of results. The user can then see the details for each result to get information about 
				a potential device recall including manufacturer information. The manufacturer information is also 
				linked to Google and their telephone number is optimized for quick communication with the manufacturer
				(tap it on a mobile phone to dial directly).

			<h2>Our technology</h2>
			<p> 
				This application is built entirely on an open-source application stack. We use the very popular
				Spring framework to create a Java Web Application which can run as a standalone application or 
				inside a Java container. For the front-end we use 
				<a class="underline" href="http://angularjs.org" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> and 
				<a class="underline" href="http://purecss.io" target="_blank">PureCSS</a> as our JavaScript MVC framework and CSS
				framework respectively.   
			</p>
			<p>
				Running on an open-source stack we were able to build this application from the bottom up in 
				a matter of 2 weeks. A more detailed explanation of our technology stack can be found at 
				<a class="underline" href="https://github.com/BridgePhase/ctf/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">our Github repository</a>
			</p>

			<h2>Our processes</h2>
			<p>
				One of our goals was to manage the creation of this prototype as an Agile project. Therefore, our
				processes were at a minimum and evolved from day one. We used Github's issue tracking mechanism 
				to track our user stories, tasks, and bugs. We created sprints by grouping issues into milestones.
				This break up allowed us to have focused tasks during our short sprint intervals. Each person in 
				our team had <a class="underline" ui-sref="aboutUs">defined roles</a> but it did not mean we didn't help each other when necessary. 
			</p>
			<h3>Bashing bugs!</h3>
			<p>
				Various people from our team took an active part in finding and documenting bugs as Github issues 
				during our development. On Monday June 29, 2015 we also held a <em>Bug Bash</em> session to find as many
				issues as we could on the application in a two hour period. The testing performed by our team 
				helped polish the application and led to various design changes ranging from the UI to our backend
				(we had to implement 
				<a class="underline"
					href="https://github.com/BridgePhase/ctf/blob/master/documentation/Caching.md" target="_blank">
				smart caching logic</a>).

			<h3>Getting our code out the door</h3>	
			<p>
				Deployments to our production environment were controlled through Github pull requests that needed
				approval by our Product Owner. All the builds and deployments were automatically done by TravisCI.
				You can get more information about the technical aspects of our builds and deployments by visiting
				<a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BridgePhase/ctf/blob/master/documentation/CI-CD.md">our CI/CD documentation</a> on 
				Github.
