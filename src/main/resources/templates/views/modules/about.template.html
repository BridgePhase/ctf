		<h2>Our approach</h2>
		<p>Our goal was to create an application using data from  <a href="https://open.fda.gov" target="_blank">Open FDA</a> that demonstrated various ways of consumption. This application 
		shows 4 different approaches of consuming and presenting said data.
		</p>
		
		<p>When starting the project during our whiteboarding sessions, our initial concern was 
			formulating an idea to proceed with the various types of data provided. We saw that 
			the Open FDA site already provided graphical information about some sample queries 
			so we understood that we would need to go beyond simple graphing. One part that jumped 
			out was the statistic on one of the Open FDA graphs about recalls with the word "ice cream"
			in the description. So as a first go, we came up with the idea that it would be very 
			informative to generate headlines using the data from Open FDA in a human readable format
			as opposed to a graph.
