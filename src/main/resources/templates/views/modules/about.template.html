			<h2>Our approach</h2>
			<p>Our goal was to create an application using data from  <a class="underline" href="https://open.fda.gov" target="_blank">openFDA</a> that demonstrated various ways of consumption. This application 
			shows 4 different approaches of consuming and presenting said data.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Initial stage</h3>
			<p>
				<img src="/ctf/images/whiteboarding.jpg"
					class="article-picture article-right" 
					alt="Whiteboard picture with the teams' original ideas" 
					title="Our initial whiteboarding ideas" />

				During our initial whiteboarding sessions, we brainstormed what could be done with the various types of data provided. We saw that the openFDA site already provided graphical information using some sample queries, so we knew we would need to go beyond simple graphing. One part that jumped out was a statistic on a graph about recalls with the word "ice cream" in the description. We then came up with the idea that it would be very informative to generate headlines using the data from openFDA in a human readable format. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This idea worked well, and some of us being Bill Nye fans, decided to name the site "Consider the following" which is based on a segment of his Bill Nye the Science Guy show. His segment presented viewers with cool facts about various subjects, so our headlines are meant to present cool automatically generated statistics derived from the openFDA data. With the first method of data consumption in place, we decided to work with all three types of datasets (food, medicines, and medical devices) in order to demonstrate three additional types of data interaction based on the amount and usability of the data openFDA provides.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through some brainstorming, we came up with the following:
				<ol>
					<li>For Food, we show recalls by state</li>
					<li>For Medicines, we provide a search for events related to a certain medicines</li>
					<li>For Medical Devices, we show a pre-defined search and the ability to view details.</li>
					<li>For the homepage, we generate human readable headlines based on the statistics retrieved from openFDA</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Food</h3>
			<p>
				The goal of this page is to show food recalls that affect a given state. In order to make 
				it more usable, the application pre-selects the current user's state based on 
				geolocation information. The application also highlights information about the recall and
				populates a US map based on other areas affected by the same recall. If the user needs more
				information about the manufacturer, the application provides a link to Google search results
				based on the manufacturer's name and address.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Medicines</h3>
			<p>
				The medicines page allows the user to search for one or many medicines. Based on that search, the application queries openFDA for counts of various serious adverse events including deaths, hospitalizations, and life threatening events. Using this data, the application generates a stacked bar chart grouped by patient age using the <a class="underline" href="http://c3js.org" target="_blank">C3 graphing library</a>.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Medical Devices</h3>
			<p>
				The data the openFDA API provides for medical devices does not lend itself to the general public.
				Due to this, the application keeps this screen simple and renders the results of a pre-defined query
				to a list of results. The user can then see the details for each result to get information about 
				a potential device recall including manufacturer information. The manufacturer information is also 
				linked to Google and their telephone number is optimized for quick communication with the manufacturer
				(tap it on a mobile phone to dial directly).
			</p>
			
			<h3>Headlines</h3>
			<p>
				We implemented human readable headlines for the homepage for two reasons. First, it grabs the user's attention when navigating to the homepage by presenting interesting facts dealing with data from openFDA. Second, it showcases a different manner of interacting with data by providing more than graphs and tables. The headlines are generated from count queries using pre-defined criteria, one of the future goals is to make this criteria more dynamic.

			<h2>Our technology</h2>
			<p> 
				This application is built entirely on an open-source application stack. We use the Spring framework to create a Java Web Application which can run as a standalone application or inside a Java container. For the front-end we use 
				<a class="underline" href="http://angularjs.org" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> and <a class="underline" href="http://purecss.io" target="_blank">PureCSS</a> as our JavaScript MVC framework and CSS framework respectively.   
			</p>
			<p>
				Running on an open-source stack we were able to build this application from the bottom up in 
				a matter of 2 weeks. A more detailed explanation of our technology stack can be found at 
				<a class="underline" href="https://github.com/BridgePhase/ctf/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">our Github repository</a>

			<h2>Our processes</h2>
			<p>
				One of our goals was to manage the creation of this prototype as an Agile project. Therefore, our
				processes were at a minimum and evolved from day one. Grouping issues into milestones created our sprints, and we used Github's issue tracking mechanism to track our user stories, tasks, and bugs. This break up allowed us to have focused tasks during our short sprint intervals. Each person in  our team had <a class="underline" ui-sref="aboutUs">defined roles</a> but it did not mean we did not help each other when necessary. 
			</p>
			<h3>Bashing bugs!</h3>
			<p>
				
				Various people from our team took an active part in finding and documenting bugs as Github issues during development. On Monday, June 29, 2015 we also held a "Bug Bash"" session to find as many issues as we could in the application within a two hour period. The testing performed by our team helped polish the application and led to various design changes ranging from the UI to our backend (<a class="underline"
					href="https://github.com/BridgePhase/ctf/blob/master/documentation/Caching.md" target="_blank">
				smart caching logic</a> for example).

			<h3>Getting our code out the door</h3>	
			<p>
				All the builds and deployments were automatically done by TravisCI. Deployments to our production environment were controlled through Github, and pull requests to `master` first required approval by our Product Owner. You can get more information about the technical aspects of our builds and deployments by visiting our <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BridgePhase/ctf/blob/master/documentation/CI-CD.md">our CI/CD documentation</a> on Github
