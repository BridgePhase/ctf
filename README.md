## This README.md file should explain the following:

* Assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes   
  at a minimum two of the labor categories limited to the Development Pool   
  labor categories to develop the prototype as quoted in Attachment C.   
  The quoter’s proposed mix of labor categories and level of effort for   
  its working prototype, as reflected in Attachment C, shall be evaluated   
  to assess the quoter’s understanding and capability to supply agile delivery services
  * **RESULT:** - Already have this as part of our About Us page. Including titles of people who worked on the project.
* Used at least five modern and open-source technologies, regardless of   
  architectural layer(frontend, backend etc)   
  * **RESULT:** - This is documented in the [Technologies](documentation/Technologies.md) document
* Deployed the prototype on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or   
  Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider, explanation (link) and indicated   
  which provider was used
  * **RESULT:** - This is documented in the [Technologies](documentation/Technologies.md) document
* Wrote unit tests for their code
  * **RESULT:** - This is documented in the code itself under the [Java Test](src/test/java) folder
* Set up or used a continuous integration system to automate the running of   
  tests and continuously deployed their code to their IaaS or PaaS provider   
  * **RESULT:** - This is documented in the [CI/CD](documentation/CI-CD.md) document
* Set up or used configuration management   
  * **RESULT:** - This is documented in the [CI/CD](documentation/CI-CD.md) document
* Set up or used continuous monitoring
  * **RESULT:** - This is documented in the [Monitoring](documentation/Monitoring.md) document
* Deploy their software in a container (i.e., utilized operating-system-level virtualization)
  * **RESULT:** - This is documented in the [CI/CD](documentation/CI-CD.md) document
* Used an interactive approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or   
  versions of the prototype   
  * **RESULT:** - This is documented in the [Processes](documentation/Processes.md) document
* Provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine   
  prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly   
  licensed and free of charge
  * **RESULT:** - This is documented in the [Getting Started](documentation/GettingStarted.md) document
